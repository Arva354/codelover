Hi. I made this code for new coders to make a car game out of HTML,CSS,And JAVASCRIPT. Credits To Code With Harry. Here is his tutorial https://www.codewithharry.com/videos/moving-lamborghini-car-animation/
also check out my scratch account https://scratch.mit.edu/users/arva354/ . Thanks For Downloading This Code.


First make an html file then in it type the following codes

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

next remember to make an css and javascript file and connect it with this

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<script src="script.js"></script>
